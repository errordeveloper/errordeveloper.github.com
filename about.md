# Statement of Interests

_This is intended as a suplementary description to my [CV][]._

_Some of my major interests and the design techniques (best know to me) shall
be outlined below; this is in an attempt to describe the directions of my
personal project as of now (as of Q3 2011)._


 I have a great interest in network-embedded system applications with low-power
 wireless (WSN: P802.15.4/6loWPAN) and wired LAN deployments for control,
 monitoring and sensing applications as well as high-bandwidth systems, e.g.
 Ethernet AVB, computing clusters and storage devices.

 My choices of design decisions vary between off-the-shelf system-on-chip ICs
 and FPGA platforms,  DSP-specific architectures and micro-controllers
 (including AVR, ARM, XMOS, SHARC & SPARC).

 I posses a good knowledge of design tools, including GCC, SDCC, XMOS, Xilinx,
 Altera, Matlab, Modelsim and many open-source tools as well as productivity
 and source code revision control, in particular GNU make, git, and scripting
 languages - _Tcl/Tk_, _csh/awk/sed_ & _Ruby_.

 I have had a very well weighted amount of practical and work-place experience
 with Linux operating system on servers, workstations and embedded systems. I
 also have experience of using other UNIX-like OS's and a very good
 understanding of system software design in general and  have practiced on a
 project involving resource-constrained operating systems, such as _TinyOS_
 and _Contiki_.

 My best choice of a programming language is _C_, and whether _C++_ would be
 applicable, I would give my preference to _D_. And, whether resources permit,
 I will most likely opt _Ruby_ for it's elegance.
 I should also specify that my favourite HDL is _Verilog_, though I have had
 studied _VHDL_ and do appreciate some of its features.

 I am a big supporter of open-source ecosystem and have desired to contribute
 to the community as much as I can. I do genuinely believe that the free
 software shall gain an equal level of acceptance in all areas of engineering,
 once the appreciation of its benefits will be truly understood.
